Hi everyone!
I'm Iris, a PhD student in computational linguistics in the [Department of Language Science and Technology](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html) at Saarland University. I'm in [Alexander Koller's](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~koller/) research group. 

My reaserch focuses at the moment on the [Interactive cookbook](https://github.com/interactive-cookbook) project and I collaborate with Alexander Koller and [Lucia Donatelli](http://luciadonatelli.georgetown.domains/). You can find more info about the project [here](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/piece-of-news/interactive-cookbook/). Due to my interdisciplinary academic background, my research interests range from  NLP-oriented to pure linguistic matters. On one side, indeed, I explore language representations, dialogue systems, and graph-based semantics in my academic role at Saarland University. On the other hand, I'm deeply fascinated by the pragmatic use of language, especially through a cross-cultural and a cross-environmental lens.


Academic background
======
Before coming to Saarbrücken, I did my Bachelor's and Master's of Arts at the University of Bonn in [Deutsch-Italienische Studien](https://www.deutsch-italienische-studien.uni-bonn.de/) (German and Italian studies), which brought me to the University of Florence for one and a half years. My strong passion for linguistics prompted my second Master's of Arts in [Applied Linguistics](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/studying/degree-programs/degree-programs-a-z/applied-linguistics-ma), that I faced with the support of a scholarship of the [Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de/). 

An internship at the [Fraunhofer Institut for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics FKIE in Wachtberg](https://www.fkie.fraunhofer.de/) has opened the doors of the field of Computational Linguistics to me. I graduated at the institute in 2021 under the supervision of [Ulrich Schade](https://www.fraunhofer-innovisions.de/experten/ulrich-schade/) and Daniel Claeser; my dissertation carries the title "Uncovering Twitter’s account closure and suspension algorithm with the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP): An investigation of the role of language in an account’s deactivation".

Outside my work in academia, I love to travel, paint, dance, and -conformly with my Italian origins- cook.
